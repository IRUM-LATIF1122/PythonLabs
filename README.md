# Python Lab 1 - Basics

This repository contains my first Python lab, covering fundamental concepts like comments, input/output, data types, special characters, string operations, string slicing, lists, and list slicing.

## Lab Overview
- **Comments**: How to write comments in Python using `#`.  
- **Input/Output**: Using `input()` to take input and `print()` to display output.  
- **Data Types**: Introduction to integers, floats, complex numbers, strings, and booleans.  
- **List Operations**: Creating and printing lists with different data types.  
- **List Slicing**: Extracting sublists and reversing lists using slicing.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.  
2. Run the file in your terminal or any IDE (like PyCharm) using:  
   ```bash
   python lab1.py
   ```

# Python Basics: Arithmetic Operators, Conditional Statements & Logical Operators

## Overview
This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of Python, including:
- Arithmetic Operators
- Operator Precedence
- Predefined Functions (round, abs)
- Conditional Statements
- Logical Operators
- A Simple Weight Converter Program

## Contents
### 1. Arithmetic Operators
Python supports the following arithmetic operators:
- **Addition (`+`)**: Adds two numbers
- **Subtraction (`-`)**: Subtracts one number from another
- **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiplies two numbers
- **Division (`/`)**: Divides one number by another
- **Remainder (`%`)**: Returns the remainder of a division
- **Exponent (`**`)**: Raises one number to the power of another

The program includes examples of each arithmetic operation.

### 2. Operator Precedence
The precedence of operators in Python is:
1. Parentheses `()` - Highest precedence
2. Exponentiation `**`
3. Multiplication `*`, Division `/`
4. Addition `+`, Subtraction `-`

Examples in the code demonstrate how Python evaluates expressions based on these rules.

### 3. Predefined Functions
The program showcases built-in Python functions:
- **`round()`**: Rounds a floating-point number.
- **`abs()`**: Returns the absolute value of a number.

### 4. Conditional Statements
Conditional statements allow for decision-making in Python:
- **`if` Statement**: Executes a block of code if a condition is true.
- **`if-else` Statement**: Executes different blocks of code based on a condition.
- **`if-elif-else` Statement**: Evaluates multiple conditions sequentially.

Examples include:
- Weather conditions (hot, cold, pleasant)
- House purchase decision based on credit
- Pass/Fail grading system
- Name length validation

### 5. Logical Operators
Logical operators are used for multiple conditions:
- **`and`**: Returns `True` if both conditions are `True`
- **`or`**: Returns `True` if at least one condition is `True`
- **`not`**: Reverses the Boolean value

Examples include loan eligibility checks and weather conditions.

### 6. Weight Converter Program
This simple program converts weight between kilograms (`kg`) and pounds (`lbs`):
- Takes user input for weight.
- Asks for the unit (`kg` or `lbs`).
- Converts and displays the weight in the appropriate unit.
