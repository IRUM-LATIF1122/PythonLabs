# Python Lab 1 - Basics

This repository contains my first Python lab, covering fundamental concepts like comments, input/output, data types, special characters, string operations, string slicing, lists, and list slicing.

## Lab Overview
- **Comments**: How to write comments in Python using `#`.  
- **Input/Output**: Using `input()` to take input and `print()` to display output.  
- **Data Types**: Introduction to integers, floats, complex numbers, strings, and booleans.  
- **List Operations**: Creating and printing lists with different data types.  
- **List Slicing**: Extracting sublists and reversing lists using slicing.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.  
2. Run the file in your terminal or any IDE (like PyCharm) using:  
   ```bash
   python lab1.py
   ```
